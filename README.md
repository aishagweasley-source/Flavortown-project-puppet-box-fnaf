# Flavortown-project-puppet-box-fnaf
this project is inspired by a game from fnaf. its a simple project where im going to make a mini robot of the marrionnete puppet(charlie) from fnaf. how it works is that i will be using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance, and servos as arms to do a scare reaction for the puppt.

# what does it do? 
so because its reaction is an ultrasonic based thing, whenevr somthing/someone is in from of the puppet box, it will do a scare reaction with various moods.
what i mean by scare reaction is the moods of the robot, so for e.g maybe theres at a certain distance maybe 20 cm, the robot will have a scare mood where it will start making noises and the arms AKA the servos will moce at a certain angle at a certain time
